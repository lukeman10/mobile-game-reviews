    "rating": "3",
    "review": "This game is such a knock off of Fall Guys. Many of the maps are very similar to Fall Guys maps. That being said there are still quite a few original maps. The gameplay is pretty good overall. Way to many ads.",
    "pros": "Gameplay is good. Original maps are all right. Events are pretty cool.",
    "cons": "Still a very much knock off of Fall Guys. It's literally in the name. Onl play if you don't have a device that can play Fall Guys."
