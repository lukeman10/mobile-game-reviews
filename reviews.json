    "rating": 3,
    "review": "This game is such a knock off of Fall Guys. Many of the maps are very similar to Fall Guys maps. That being said there are still quite a few original maps. The gameplay is pretty good overall. Way to many ads.",
    "pros": "Gameplay is good. Original maps are all right. Events are pretty cool.",
    "cons": "Still a very much knock off of Fall Guys. It's literally in the name. Onl play if you don't have a device that can play Fall Guys."

    "game": "Dadish",
    "rating": 5,
    "review": "This is an amazing game by an indie game dev. It is truly a great platformer about a radish who is a dad(Dadish) who goes looking for his kids because they ran off. The levels are challenging but not too hard. There is always some comedic dialogue at the end of each level. The bosses are also really fun. Go download it now!!!",
    "pros": "One of the best games I have ever played. The dialogue is great and the enemies and level design is really interesting. ",
    "cons": "The only con is that there are ads."
